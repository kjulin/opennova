description: Organization, outline, and document flow
prompt: |
  Focus on document structure and organization. Watch for:
  - Logical ordering of sections and ideas
  - Missing sections or gaps in coverage
  - Redundant or misplaced content
  - Transitions between sections
  - Overall coherence and narrative flow

  Suggest structural improvements. Only comment when reorganization would meaningfully
  improve the document.
