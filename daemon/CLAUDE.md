# Claude Code Notes

## Workflow

- Track all ideas, bugs, and improvements as GitHub issues on kjulin/opennova. Use `gh issue create` to file them during sessions rather than leaving TODOs in code or notes.
- Never commit directly to master. Always create a feature/fix branch, commit there, and open a PR against master linking to the relevant issue. Use `gh pr create` to create PRs.
- Never merge PRs or push to master without explicit user approval. Always wait for confirmation before merging.
