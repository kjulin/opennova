export const TELEGRAM_HELP_MESSAGE = `You can chat with me about anything — ask questions, manage tasks, research topics, or just have a conversation. I run on your computer, so I can also access files and run commands when needed.

*Agents*
Nova comes with multiple agents you can switch between with /agent <name>.

• *Nova* — your general-purpose assistant (that's me)
• *Agent Builder* — creates new agents through conversation. Just describe what you want and it will build it for you. Switch to it with /agent agent-builder.

*Commands*
/threads — list and switch conversation threads
/new — start a fresh conversation thread
/agent — select an agent
/tasks — list and switch to task threads
/stop — stop the running agent
/help — show this message`;
